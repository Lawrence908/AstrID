## **ASTR-98: GitHub Actions (P2) - CI/CD Pipeline**

### **Context & Current State**
Test framework is set up (ASTR-93 ✅), providing the foundation for automated testing. This ticket implements the complete CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated testing, code quality checks, deployment, and security scanning.

### **Technical Requirements**

**Dependencies**: ASTR-93 (Test Framework Setup) - ✅ Complete
**Domain**: CI/CD Pipeline
**Estimated Time**: 2 days

### **Implementation Tasks**

1. **Set up Automated Testing**
   - Create `.github/workflows/` directory structure
   - Implement testing workflows:
     - `test.yml` - Unit and integration tests
     - `test-e2e.yml` - End-to-end tests
     - `test-performance.yml` - Performance tests
     - `test-security.yml` - Security tests
   - Add test matrix for multiple Python versions
   - Implement test result reporting and notifications
   - Add test coverage reporting and trending

2. **Add Code Quality Checks**
   - Create code quality workflows:
     - `lint.yml` - Code linting with Ruff
     - `type-check.yml` - Type checking with MyPy
     - `format.yml` - Code formatting with Black
     - `security.yml` - Security scanning with Bandit
   - Add pre-commit hook validation
   - Implement code quality gates
   - Add code quality reporting and metrics

3. **Implement Automated Deployment**
   - Create deployment workflows:
     - `deploy-staging.yml` - Staging environment deployment
     - `deploy-production.yml` - Production environment deployment
     - `deploy-docs.yml` - Documentation deployment
   - Add environment-specific configurations
   - Implement deployment approval gates
   - Add rollback capabilities and monitoring

4. **Add Security Scanning**
   - Implement security workflows:
     - `security-scan.yml` - Dependency vulnerability scanning
     - `secrets-scan.yml` - Secrets detection
     - `container-scan.yml` - Container security scanning
     - `code-scan.yml` - Code security analysis
   - Add security reporting and alerting
   - Implement security policy enforcement
   - Add compliance reporting

### **Integration Points**

- **Testing**: Integrate with ASTR-93 test framework
- **Deployment**: Connect to ASTR-96 Docker setup
- **Monitoring**: Integrate with system monitoring
- **Security**: Connect to security scanning tools
- **Documentation**: Automate documentation updates

### **Workflow Configuration**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
name: Test Suite
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.11, 3.12]
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
      
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest --cov=src --cov-report=xml
      
      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

### **Deployment Workflows**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy-production.yml
name: Deploy to Production
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    tags: ['v*']

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: |
          # Deployment commands
          docker build -t astrid:latest .
          docker push astrid:latest
          # Production deployment
```

### **Security Scanning Configuration**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/security-scan.yml
name: Security Scan
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 1'  # Weekly on Monday
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run security scan
        uses: securecodewarrior/github-action-add-sarif@v1
        with:
          sarif-file: security-results.sarif
```

### **Code Quality Gates**
```yaml
# Quality Gates Configuration
quality_gates:
  test_coverage: 90
  code_quality_score: 8.0
  security_score: 9.0
  performance_score: 8.5
  documentation_coverage: 80
```

### **Error Handling**
- Workflow failure notification and alerting
- Deployment rollback on failure
- Test failure analysis and reporting
- Security vulnerability handling
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### **Testing Strategy**
- Workflow execution testing
- Deployment process validation
- Security scanning accuracy testing
- Code quality gate validation
- Performance testing for CI/CD pipeline

### **Performance Considerations**
- Parallel job execution optimization
- Caching for dependencies and build artifacts
- Workflow execution time monitoring
- Resource usage optimization
- Build artifact management
