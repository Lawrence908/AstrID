CSCI 491: senior research project
Course outline (template)
This document can serve as a general template for senior research projects, but will need to be customized to be appropriate for the specific project undertaken.
The project outline needs to be approved by the student, the supervisor, committee, the head of department, and received by the dean of the faculty - all by mid-September. (Thus discussing projects with the intended supervisor should be done as early as possible - preferably over the summer.)

Student: ___YOU____
PROJECT TITLE: ___???____

Supervisor: Dr. David Wessels

Committee members: (at least one other CS faculty member)

Proposal: CSCI 491 Senior Research Project (6 credits)

September x, 20xx through April xx, 20xx

Pre-requisites: 4th year standing and at least a B average in your five most recent computer science courses.


Topic outline:

Here we would insert a general description of your specific project, what you hope to accomplish, and why the project is of industry/academic interest.
Project description:

Here we would provide more specific details about the manner in which the project would be conducted, the specific areas to be researched, the specific deliverables to be produced, the processes to be followed, and what specific goals need to be attained for an A+, a B, a C, etc.
Note that all findings must be documented in a detailed, carefully written and reviewed project report, including the products of the above steps. Most importantly, a critical analysis of the approach and methodology for this problem must be produced.

The implementation will then demonstrate a meaningful subset of these features as a demonstration of their feasibility.

Project Deliverables and Schedule:

The student and instructor will meet weekly (time and location TBA) to review the project progress, design and implementation options, and the best means of attaining the project's short term and long term goals.

At each meeting the student is expected to provide a short (10-15 minute) briefing on the state of the project, and to bring current copies of relevant documents (see the project timetable detailed below).

In accordance with the goals of the project, the deliverables and evaluation will be as shown below. Except where indicated otherwise, the deliverables will be submitted directly to the project supervisor.


Preliminary project proposal, course outline:
This document provides an initial plan and overview for the intended project, outlining the preliminary readings and investigations the student will undertake, the broad scope and nature of the project, and the way the student plans to work towards a full project proposal.
Timeline:
To committee no later than September 16, with the approved version submitted to the head of department no later than September 23, and to the dean of the faculty by September 30.
Project proposal, presentation and defense (for the committee)
Roughly half way through the project, a short formal presentation must be held in which the student summarizes the current state of the project for the committee members. At least a week prior to this presentation, a complete proposal document (including results from the investigation to date, and a design, test, and experimentation plan for the balance of the project) must be presented to the committee members (to ensure they have an opportunity to review it prior to the presentation). The committee members will provide feedback and specify any additional project requirements and deliverables based on the document(s) and presentation.
Timeline:
For the supervisor (rehearsal): By January 15 (with the draft document submitted no later than 7 days prior to the practice presentation)
For the committee: By January 30: (with the proposal document submitted no later than 7 days prior to the presentation)
A draft of the project criteria required for the student to pass the project, and the specific project criteria required for the student to pass "with distinction" or "with honours" will be formulated by the student and supervisor as part of the original proposal, with revised criteria established by the committee and the student no later than January 31, 2006.

Completed project report and implementation
Once the design and progress reports have been evaluated, the student will spend most of the second semester of the project carrying out the implementation and experimentation of the project. During this time, the student will also be finalizing the formal project report, encompassing the information from all previous stages and the information gleaned during the implementation, test, and experimentation process.
Timeline:
Draft version (submitted to the supervisor) By April 8 (but no later than 21 days prior to the intended defense data)
Revised version (submitted to the supervisor) By April 15 (but no later than 14 days prior to the defense)
Defence version (submitted to the committee) By April 23 (but no later than 7 days prior to the defense)
Final approved version (accepted by all committee members) By May 30
Project presentation and oral examination
Once the project implementaton and experimentation is completed, and the supervisor has approved the state of the project report, the student will submit the report to the committe members and conduct a (20 minute) formal public presentation (and possibly demonstration) of the project. Following the presentation, committee members and other CS faculty members will question the student on the project, report, and presentation. Following the question session, the committee members will privately evaluate the project and make recommendations on any required changes or additions.
Timeline:
For the supervisor (rehearsal): By April 23
For the committee and public: By April 30:

BOTH THE PROJECT REPORT AND THE PRESENTATION SHOULD BE WRITTEN IN A MANNER THAT IS UNDERSTANDABLE FOR A TYPICAL THIRD-YEAR COMPUTER SCIENCE STUDENT.

Note that the report is a major undertaking, typically representing 50-70 pages of formal content aside from any supporting code and data. As such, it will require many hours of writing and revision, and the student should plan their semester appropriately.


Each section's submission will contribute to the final report, including details of possible alternatives and justification for the choice made, as well as a description of that choice.

Deliverables are expected to take into account changes, recommendations, and decisions reached based on previous deliverables.

The final project report will thus include both a formal description of the project, the research behind it, the practical implementation of the project, a description of the rationale behind the implementation choices, and experimentation to show the strengths and weaknesses of the chosen approaches.

The project will be graded by the committee members based on the project presentation, project report, and project deliverables, and will produce one of the following defense outcomes:

Pass with no changes - the committee is satisfied the student's efforts meet the required standard and neither additional work nor changes to the report are required
Pass with minor changes - the committee is satisfied that the work meets the required standard, but the report requires minor revision which will be reviewed by the supervisor
Pass with major changes - the committee is satisfied that the work meets the required standard, but the report requires extensive revision which will be reviewed by both committee members
Incomplete - the committee does not believe the work meets the required standard but believes it is possible to do so within a short period of time. In this case, the inadequate components will be outlined to the student and deadlines for completion of the components given. In this case, the student will be re-examined upon timely completion of the required components.
Fail - neither the work nor the report meet the required standard and the committee does not foresee a quick resolution. In this case the student will receive a failing grade for the course.
The lettergrade for the course is established by the committee, and is based on the student's success at meeting the requirements and deliverables which were communicated to the student following the end of the first semester (i.e. following evaluation of the project proposal presentation and defense).

The letter grade assigned will be one of the following four:

Pass with honours: A+
Pass with distinction: B+
Pass: C
Fail: F
