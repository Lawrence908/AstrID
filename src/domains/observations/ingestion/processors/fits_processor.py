"""FITS file processing utilities - MOVED TO PREPROCESSING DOMAIN.

This file is now a placeholder. The functionality has been moved to:
- Basic FITS I/O: src/adapters/imaging/fits_io.py (lightweight, no cv2/matplotlib dependencies)
- Advanced processing: src/domains/preprocessing/processors/fits_processing.py (with cv2/matplotlib)

This was done to avoid loading heavy dependencies during API startup.
"""

# Placeholder to maintain imports until refactoring is complete
# All functionality moved to appropriate domains following DDD architecture
