## Usage Examples

### Basic Training
```python
from notebooks.training.utils.training_manager import TrainingManager

# Initialize training manager
training_manager = TrainingManager(
    config=config,
    experiment_tracker=experiment_tracker,
    model_registry=model_registry,
    mlflow_client=mlflow_client,
    gpu_monitor=gpu_monitor,
    energy_tracker=energy_tracker
)

# Start training
run_id = await training_manager.start_training_run(
    model=model,
    train_loader=train_loader,
    val_loader=val_loader,
    optimizer=optimizer,
    criterion=criterion,
    scheduler=scheduler
)
```

### Custom Metrics
```python
from notebooks.training.utils.performance_metrics import ComprehensiveMetricsCalculator

# Calculate comprehensive metrics
metrics_calculator = ComprehensiveMetricsCalculator()
metrics = metrics_calculator.calculate_all_metrics(
    y_true, y_pred, y_scores, inference_times, batch_size
)
```

### Energy Analysis
```python
from src.core.energy_analysis import EnergyAnalyzer

# Analyze energy consumption
