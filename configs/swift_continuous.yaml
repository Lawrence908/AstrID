# SWIFT Continuous Coverage Dataset Configuration
#
# SWIFT has been operational since 2004 and continues today, making it
# the ONLY UV mission with continuous coverage spanning 20+ years.
# This makes SWIFT the most reliable source for UV difference imaging
# of supernovae from any era.
#
# SWIFT UVOT provides 6 filters: UVW2, UVM2, UVW1, U, B, V
