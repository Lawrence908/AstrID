# TESS All-Sky Modern Dataset Configuration
#
# TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) launched 2018 and provides
# near-continuous all-sky coverage. While primarily for exoplanets,
# TESS has captured many transients including supernovae.
#
# Coverage: ~85% of the sky with 27-day continuous viewing per sector
# Cadence: 30-min (full-frame), 2-min (selected targets)
# 
# Note: TESS has large pixels (21"/pixel) - best for bright, nearby SNe.
