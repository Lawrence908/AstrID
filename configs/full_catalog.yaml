# Full Catalog — All Missions, Full Time Range
#
# Single pipeline run over the entire supernova catalog with all MAST missions.
# Use when you want the largest possible dataset in one go (no year or index limits).
#
# Trade-off vs best_yield_combined:
#   - best_yield: 2005–2011, GALEX+SWIFT+HST — smaller, highest density of
#     same-mission pairs (GALEX golden era). Often enough for a large training set.
#   - full_catalog: 2000–present, all missions — maximum SNe and missions;
#     more runtime, more disk; some missions sparse in early years.
#
# OOM note: If the query stage is killed (SIGKILL/OOM), run with fewer other
# heavy jobs, or reduce chunk_size further (e.g. 100). Dense fields (e.g. CDFS)
# can make MAST return very large result sets.
