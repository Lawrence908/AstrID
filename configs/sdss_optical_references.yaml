# SDSS Optical Reference Dataset Configuration
#
# SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) provides excellent ground-based optical
# imaging covering ~35% of the sky. SDSS imaging was taken 2000-2009,
# making it ideal for REFERENCE images for more recent supernovae.
#
# Strategy: Use SDSS for reference, pair with SWIFT/HST for science images.
# Note: SDSS is available in MAST but coverage is limited to SDSS footprint.
