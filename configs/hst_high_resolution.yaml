# HST High-Resolution Dataset Configuration
#
# HST (Hubble Space Telescope) provides the highest resolution space-based
# optical/UV imaging. While coverage is limited to targeted observations,
# famous nearby supernovae often have extensive HST follow-up.
#
# Best for: High-quality difference images of well-studied SNe.
# Examples: SN 2014J (M82), SN 2011fe (M101), SN 1987A, etc.
